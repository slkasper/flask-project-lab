(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/redfin-housing-market-prices)
had to change to this one:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/halimedogan/real-estate-dataset

This is a simpler dataset, so no special work. just open the .zip and use the .csv

(Reading the Data
The data is a .tsv format and can be imported using pandas as follows:
df = pd.read_csv("weekly_housing_market_data_most_recent.tsv000", sep='\t') )
